**PREPARED ERP MODULE ARCHITECTURE FOR .NET**

Nowadays we are trying to find a shortcut to save time and money while developing modules for software. So as I researched, the ERP sector, some kind of the modules
were given as prepared and making some little changes helps the companies save time and money only for specific software technologies i.e SAP, ORACLE, ABAP, etc.
so I thought that why .NET does not have prepared modules for the ERP solutions so, created a path to develop a Finance and Product management module for a company,
this module is considered easy to develop and prepare core properties.

In the future, more features can be added and I want it to be the first step prepared modules for .NET ERP solutions.

In the future not only for Product and Finance, it might be developed as Customer management, Human resources, Currency and Bank processes, Production Following,
Ship and Container Management, Accounting and Logistics.

So main purpose is to develop a core backend architecture for Finance and Product for now.

Additional Note: The technology, libaries and patterns i used were learnt from the company i worked. I tried to use each method i learnt for a project.

Libraries which were used
- ASP.NET Core
- EntityFrameworkCore
- LinqKit (Filter builder)
- FluentValidation
- Dapper
- NewtonSoft (Planned to use to have communication external files)
- xUnit (For unit testing)
